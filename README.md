# Portfolio
Anna Yesaulov's Portfolio.

The purpose of this website is to show potential employer's my completed (future) projects in Web Development. 
I created this project in VS Code. 
In this Portfolio there is a section with some information about me, and for now a previous assignment in refactoring a website.
There is also a section with my contact information and a link to my GitHub.
